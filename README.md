# House-price-predictor

# Problem Statement:
The problem addressed in this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the price of houses based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms. The goal is to provide accurate price estimates to assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

# Action of Work:

- Data Preprocessing: The dataset of house prices in Bengaluru is loaded and unnecessary columns are removed. Missing values are handled appropriately, and feature engineering is performed to extract relevant information.

- Outlier Detection and Removal: Outliers in the dataset are identified and eliminated to improve the model's robustness and performance.

- Feature Engineering: Additional features, such as price per square foot, are created to enhance the model's predictive power.

- Model Training: The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The Linear Regression algorithm is chosen and trained on the training data to learn the relationship between the input features and the house prices.

- Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using various performance metrics, including the R-squared score, to assess its accuracy and generalization capability.

# Results:
The developed house price predictor model demonstrates good performance in estimating house prices based on the given features. The model achieves a high accuracy rate, indicating its ability to capture the underlying patterns and trends in the housing market.

# Conclusion:
The house price predictor provides a reliable tool for estimating house prices in Bengaluru based on key features. It enables users to obtain quick and accurate price estimates for potential properties, aiding in decision-making processes related to buying, selling, and investing in real estate. The model's performance can be further improved by incorporating additional relevant features and exploring more advanced machine learning algorithms.
